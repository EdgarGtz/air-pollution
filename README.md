## Air Pollution

The metropolitan area of Monterrey, Mexico has one of the worst air quality conditions in the country.

And even though it's a problem that greatly affects its more than 5 million citizens, the data available is greatly
lacking in accessibility and quality. 

This project aims to solve this issue by opening air pollution data from the [Purple Air](https://www2.purpleair.com/)
sensors located across the city with the believe that better and more accessible data will help government agencies,
businesses and citizens take better action to solve this huge problem.
